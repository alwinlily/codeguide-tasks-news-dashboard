# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A new user arrives at the application by visiting the landing page or through a direct link. The landing page briefly introduces the dashboard features and provides clear options to sign up or sign in. When a user chooses to create an account, they are taken to a registration form powered by Clerk. Here they enter their email address and choose a password. They must confirm their email through a verification link sent by Clerk before gaining full access. If the user prefers, they may sign up using a supported social login, such as Google or GitHub, by clicking the corresponding button and granting permissions.

After verifying their account, the user can return to the sign-in page and log in with their credentials or social login option. When signing in, they enter their email and password or select the social provider. Clerk handles session creation and then redirects the user to the main dashboard. To sign out at any time, the user clicks the "Sign Out" button in the navigation bar, which ends the session and returns them to the landing page.

If the user forgets their password, they can click the "Forgot Password" link on the sign-in page. They are prompted to enter their registered email address, and Clerk sends a password reset link. Clicking that link opens a secure page where they can choose a new password. Once the password is updated, they can sign in again as usual.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Once signed in, the user lands on the main dashboard. At the top, a header displays the application logo, a theme switcher for light and dark modes, and a profile menu with options to access settings or sign out. Along the left side, a vertical navigation panel lists links for Dashboard, Urgent Tasks, News Feed, Weather Updates, and, if the user has the admin role, an Admin Panel link.

The central area of the dashboard shows four sections in a grid layout. The first card displays the user’s current Todo tasks and a button to view all tasks. The second section highlights the urgent tasks only. The third section presents the latest company news headlines with a link to read more. The fourth section shows the current weather in the user’s chosen location. Each section fetches its data from the corresponding API endpoint on page load.

Clicking any section or navigation link takes the user to a dedicated page for that feature. If the user has the admin role, the Admin Panel link appears in the sidebar. Clicking that link navigates them to the protected Admin Dashboard, where administrative tasks can be performed.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When a user selects the Todo Tasks link, the app navigates to `/todos`. This page lists all tasks retrieved via the `/api/todos` endpoint. Each task shows its title, due date, and status. The user can filter tasks by status or urgency. They click an "Add Task" button to open a form in a modal or separate page. The form collects the task title, description, due date, and an urgency toggle. On submission, the form calls the POST method on `/api/todos`, and upon success, the new task appears in the list.

In the Urgent Tasks section, the user goes to `/urgent` where only tasks marked as urgent are shown. They can mark tasks as complete by clicking a checkbox, which triggers a PUT request. To remove a task, they click a delete icon, which calls the DELETE method. After each action, the list refreshes automatically.

Choosing the News Feed page at `/news`, the user sees a scrollable list of news items. Each item has a title, date, and short summary. Clicking a headline opens a detail page at `/news/[id]` where the full content is displayed. On this detail page, the user finds links to return to the list or share the article. Administrators see additional buttons to edit or delete the news item, triggering the corresponding PUT or DELETE API calls.

When the user visits the Weather Updates page at `/weather`, a server-side call fetches live data from the OpenWeatherMap API via the `/api/weather` endpoint. The page displays temperature, conditions, and a small weather icon. The user can update their location in settings; once changed, the dashboard reloads the weather information.

The Admin Panel is available under `/admin`. It presents two tabs: Tasks and News. In the Tasks tab, an admin sees a table of all `TodoTask` records with columns for title, due date, urgency, and actions. The admin clicks "New Task" to open a form similar to the public UI but with full control over all fields. Editing an existing task opens the same form populated with current data. Deleting prompts a confirmation before calling the DELETE endpoint. The News tab works the same way for `CompanyNews` records.

Navigation between pages is handled by the global sidebar. Breadcrumbs at the top of each page help users track their location. Each form includes a cancel link that returns the user to the previous page.

## Settings and Account Management
The user opens settings by clicking on their profile avatar in the header and selecting "Account Settings." This takes them to `/settings`, where they can update personal information like name, email, and password through Clerk’s secure profile management. They also choose notification preferences for email alerts about new tasks or urgent updates. If they have configured their location for weather updates, they can change the city or zip code here.

All changes save via calls to Clerk or custom API routes as needed. After saving, the user sees a brief confirmation message and may click "Back to Dashboard" to return to the main view. Administrators have an additional section in settings to manage roles for other users, assigning or revoking the admin role. After any role change, the user list updates and the affected user’s access permissions adjust immediately.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If a user enters invalid data in any form, the system highlights the fields in error and displays a clear message explaining the problem. For example, if a task title is missing, a prompt appears asking the user to provide a title. If the application loses network connectivity, a full-page banner appears at the top alerting the user and pausing data requests. Once connectivity returns, the app retries the failed requests automatically.

When a non-admin user attempts to access any URL under `/admin`, the middleware intercepts the request and redirects them to a "403 Forbidden" page. This page explains that they do not have permission to view the content and offers a link back to the dashboard.

If the server encounters an unexpected error, such as a database failure, the user is shown an error page with a friendly message and a button to reload. The application logs error details to the console and a remote monitoring service.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the moment a user first visits the landing page, they are guided through a smooth registration and email verification process. Upon signing in, they arrive at a clean dashboard showing tasks, urgent items, news, and weather. They navigate effortlessly between features using the sidebar and breadcrumbs. Administrators benefit from a separate panel for managing tasks and news records with full create, read, update, and delete capabilities. Throughout the app, settings allow users to customize personal details, notification preferences, and weather location. Robust error handling and role-based access control ensure that the experience remains secure and reliable. Day to day, users check off tasks, read updates, and review company news, confident that the application will respond quickly and keep their information safe.
