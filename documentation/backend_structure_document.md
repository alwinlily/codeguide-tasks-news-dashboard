# Backend Structure Document

## 1. Backend Architecture

### Overview
The backend is built using Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript. It follows a serverless, modular design where each feature has its own API route. Key design patterns and frameworks:

- **Serverless Functions**: Each REST endpoint is a separate file under `src/app/api`. This keeps business logic isolated and easy to scale.
- **Service Layer**: Utility modules (e.g., `src/lib/prisma.ts`, `src/lib/weather.ts`) encapsulate external integrations and database interactions.
- **Middleware**: Next.js middleware is used for authentication and role-based access control, ensuring only authorized users can hit protected endpoints.
- **Frameworks**:
  - Next.js: SSR, incremental rendering, and API routes.
  - TypeScript: Static types for increased safety and better IDE support.

### Scalability, Maintainability, Performance
- **Scalability**: Serverless functions automatically scale with demand. The database client is a singleton, avoiding connection storms.
- **Maintainability**: Clear folder structure (`app`, `api`, `lib`, `prisma`) and consistent patterns reduce onboarding time.
- **Performance**:
  - Server Components fetch data on the server, minimizing client bundle size.
  - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) and caching headers speed up repeated requests.
  - Parallel data loading in `app/page.tsx` for the public dashboard ensures sub-2s page loads.

## 2. Database Management

- **Type**: Relational (SQL)
- **System**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma

### Data Flow
1. **Prisma Client** (`src/lib/prisma.ts`): A singleton instance to run queries.
2. **Data Models**: Defined in `schema.prisma` (see next section).
3. **API Routes**: Use Prisma to create, read, update, and delete records.
4. **Validation**: Zod schemas validate incoming payloads in POST/PUT routes.
5. **Migrations**: Prisma Migrate tracks schema changes and applies versioned migrations.

### Best Practices
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse a single Prisma client per serverless hot-start to avoid exhausting database connections.
- **Input Sanitization**: Zod ensures only valid data reaches Prisma.
- **Error Handling**: API routes wrap Prisma calls in `try/catch` to return clear HTTP status codes.

## 3. Database Schema

### Models (Human-Readable)
- **TodoTask**
  • `id`: unique identifier (UUID)
  • `title`: text of the task
  • `description`: longer text, optional
  • `dueDate`: date field for deadlines
  • `isUrgent`: boolean flag
  • `createdAt` / `updatedAt`: timestamps
  
- **CompanyNews**
  • `id`: unique identifier (UUID)
  • `headline`: text title
  • `content`: full article text
  • `publishedAt`: timestamp
  • `createdAt` / `updatedAt`: timestamps

### SQL Schema (PostgreSQL)
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

CREATE TABLE "TodoTask" (
  "id" UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  "title" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "description" TEXT,
  "dueDate" DATE NOT NULL,
  "isUrgent" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE "CompanyNews" (
  "id" UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  "headline" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "content" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "publishedAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

### Approach
- **RESTful**: Each resource (todos, news, urgent, weather) has its own route folder. HTTP verbs map to CRUD actions.
- **Validation**: Zod ensures request bodies match expected shapes.

### Key Endpoints

| Route                  | Method | Purpose                                                   |
|------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `/api/todos`           | GET    | List all todo tasks                                        |
| `/api/todos`           | POST   | Create a new todo task (admin only)                       |
| `/api/todos/[id]`      | PUT    | Update a specific task (admin only)                       |
| `/api/todos/[id]`      | DELETE | Delete a specific task (admin only)                       |
| `/api/news`            | GET    | List all news articles                                     |
| `/api/news`            | POST   | Create a news article (admin only)                        |
| `/api/news/[id]`       | PUT    | Update a news item (admin only)                           |
| `/api/news/[id]`       | DELETE | Delete a news item (admin only)                           |
| `/api/urgent`          | GET    | List todos where `isUrgent = true`                         |
| `/api/weather`         | GET    | Fetch current weather from OpenWeatherMap                  |

### Communication Flow
1. **Frontend** calls an endpoint (fetch or mutate).
2. **Middleware** checks auth and roles (for admin routes).
3. **Route Handler** validates input with Zod.
4. **Service Layer** (Prisma client or external fetch) executes.
5. **Response** returns JSON with data or error status.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network caches static assets and serverless responses at the edge.
- **Load Balancer**: Vercel’s routing system distributes function calls across instances.
- **Caching**:
  - **Edge Cache**: ISR for pages updated on deploy or by revalidation.
  - **Client Cache**: SWR hooks or React Query on the frontend for polling and state sync.
- **Logging & Error Tracking**:
  - Vercel logs for function invocations
  - Optional: Sentry or Datadog for real-time monitoring and alerting

These components collaborate to deliver fast, reliable responses under any load.

## 7. Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Clerk handles OAuth and email/password flows.
- **Authorization**: Next.js middleware enforces `role === 'admin'` on `/admin` pages and POST/PUT/DELETE API routes.
- **Encryption**:
  - TLS/HTTPS for all in-transit data.
  - Database encryption at rest (managed by the cloud provider).
- **Environment Variables**: Stored securely on Vercel; secrets never committed to code.
- **Input Validation**: Zod stops malformed or malicious payloads.
- **Audit Logging**: Optional hook in API routes to record admin actions.
- **Compliance**: Aligns with GDPR principles by minimizing personal data collection and securing stored data.

---

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Performance Monitoring**:
  - Vercel Analytics for page load and function metrics.
  - Database dashboards for query performance (e.g., Supabase or AWS Performance Insights).
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration to capture runtime exceptions and user-impacting errors.
- **Alerts**:
  - Email or Slack alerts for high error rates or latency spikes.
- **Maintenance Strategies**:
  - **Automated Migrations**: Prisma Migrate runs as part of CI/CD before deployment.
  - **Dependency Updates**: Dependabot or Renovate for automated PRs.
  - **Automated Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for end-to-end tests in CI.
  - **Health Checks**: Uptime monitoring (e.g., Pingdom) on key endpoints.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

This backend is a modern, serverless, and modular setup tailored for a public dashboard and protected admin panel. It uses a structured folder layout, Next.js API routes, Prisma-managed PostgreSQL, and Clerk for secure role-based access. Hosted on Vercel with a managed database, it delivers high performance and reliability. Key differentiators:

- **Serverless First**: Auto-scaling and low Ops overhead.
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript plus Zod for validation.
- **Rapid Development**: Ready-made UI components (shadcn/ui), theming, and Dev Container support.
- **Robust Security**: Middleware-enforced roles, encrypted data, and proven auth flows.

Together, these components form a cohesive, maintainable, and scalable backend that aligns perfectly with the project’s goals and user needs.
